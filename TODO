Upgrading the drivers tree
==========================

See drivers/README.txt to test the build with the targeted kernel sources.
The new version must be bumped by setting the variable PACKAGE_VERSION in
the file dkms.conf. The version tag should use the following format:

PACKAGE_VERSION=$KERNEL.$MAJOR_REV-$DATESTAMP

For all supported kernel version, make a dedicated branch as follows.

git checkout -b v$KERNEL.$MAJOR_REV
